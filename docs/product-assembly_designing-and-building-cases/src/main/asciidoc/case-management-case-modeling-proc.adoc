= Modeling a case definition

A case definition represents the flow of the case management project that differs from a normal business process workflow in that it has no clear start node. A case is event-driven with ad hoc interaction between tasks and processes, rather than following the sequential flow of a business process. Case definitions can include nodes that are configured to start automatically when a new case instance is created, as well as ad hoc nodes that are optional and can be triggered during a case when required.

Cases are modeled using the process design tool, which you can access by opening your project in {CENTRAL} and clicking *Add Asset* -> *Case definition*.
