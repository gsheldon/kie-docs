= Adding dynamic tasks to a case using the API

Dynamic tasks and processes can be added to a case during run time to address unforeseen changes that can occur during the lifecycle of a case. Dynamic activities are not defined in the case definition and therefore, they cannot be signaled the way that a defined ad hoc task or process can.

The following dynamic activities can be added to a case:

* user tasks
* service tasks (any type that is implemented as a work item)
* reusable subprocesses 

Dynamic user and service tasks are added to a case instance and immediately executed. Depending on the nature of a dynamic task, it might start and wait for completion (user task) or directly complete after execution (service task). For dynamic subprocesses, the process engine requires a KJAR containing the process definition for that dynamic process in order to locate the process by its ID and execute it. This subprocess belongs to the case and has access to all of the data in the case file.

You can use the Swagger REST API application to create dynamic tasks and subprocesses.

.Prerequisite 
You are logged in to {CENTRAL} and case instance has been started using the Showcase application. For more information about using Showcase, see 
ifeval::["{context}" == "case-management-design"]
xref:case-management-showcase-application-con-case-management-design[Case management Showcase application].

.Procedure 
. In a web browser, open the following URL: `http://localhost:8080/kie-server/docs`.
. Open the list of available endpoints under *Case instances :: Case Management*.
. Locate the `POST` method endpoints for creating dynamic activities.

. Click the REST endpoint required to create the dynamic task or process to open the documentation.
. Click the *Try it out* button to provide the parameters and body required to create the dynamic activity.
. Click *Execute* to create the dynamic task or subprocess using the REST API.
