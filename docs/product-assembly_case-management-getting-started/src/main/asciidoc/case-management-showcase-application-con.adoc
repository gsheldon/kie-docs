= Case management Showcase application 

The Showcase application is included in the {PRODUCT} distribution to demonstrate the capabilities of case management in an application environment. Showcase is intended to be used as a proof of concept that aims to show the interaction between business process management (BPM) and case management. You can use the application to create, monitor, and interact with cases that are being worked on in {CENTRAL}.

Showcase must be installed in addition to the {CENTRAL} application and {KIE_SERVER}. The Showcase application is required to start new case instances, however the case work is still performed in {CENTRAL}. 

After a case instance is created and is being worked on, you can monitor the case in the Showcase by opening the case *Overview* page.
