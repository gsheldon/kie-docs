= Configuring milestones for IT Orders 



Milestones are configured in the case definition designer by adding a `Milestone` node to the design palette.

The following milestones are configured in the IT Orders sample project:

* `Hardware spec ready` is reached when the required hardware specification document is completed. This is configured using the `org.kie.api.runtime.process.CaseData(data.get("hwSpec") != null)` condition. 
* `Manager decision` is reached once the `managerDecision` variable has been given a response. This is configured using the `org.kie.api.runtime.process.CaseData(data.get("managerDecision") != null)` condition.
* `Milestone 1: Order placed` is `Adhoc autostart`. This milestone is in a wait state until the completion condition is met. The condition for this milestone is that a case file variable named `ordered` exists with the value `true`. A script task then sends a notification that the hardware order has been placed.
* `Milestone 2: Order shipped` is triggered by a signal event once the order is ready to be sent. The condition for this milestone is that a case file variable named `shipped` is `true`. Once completed, the `Send to tracking system` script is executed.
* `Milestone 3: Delivered to customer` is triggered by a signal event once the order has successfully shipped to the customer. The condition for this milestone is that a case file variable named `delivered` is `true`. Once completed, a `Customer satisfaction survey` task is created. 

.Prerequisite

* A case project has been created in {CENTRAL}.
* A case definition has been created.

. With the milestone node selected, click image:3897.png[left arrows] to open the *Properties* panel on the right.
. Open the *Assignments* to add a completion condition. Milestones include a `condition` parameter by default. 
. To define the completion condition to for the milestone, select a case file variable from the list under *Source*, or select `Constant...` from the list.
. Configure the `Adhoc autostart` property for milestones that are required to start automatically when a case instance starts.
