* `owner` - the person requesting the hardware. There can be only one of these roles.
* `manager` - the employee's manager; the person who will approve or deny the requested hardware. The role cardinality is set to `1`, which means that only one person or group can be assigned to this role.
* `supplier` - a set of people who can order and deliver the requested and approved hardware. There is usually more than one supplier.

When the roles are known, case management must ensure that these are not hardcoded to single set of people/groups as part of case definition and that it can differ per each case instance. This is where case role assignments come into the picture and can be:

   given when case starts
   set at any given point in time while case is active
   removed at any given point in time while case is active

second and third option does not alter the task assignments for already active tasks.

[IMPORTANT]
====
 What is important to note here, is that in case management users should always use roles for task assignments instead of actual user/group names, that is to make the case as dynamic as possible so actual user/group assignment is done as late as possible. It's similar to process variables though without expression syntax.
