= Stage activation and completion conditions

Stages can be triggered by a signal event from an end node or the completion of another task node in the case definition, or it can be activated using property configuration.

You can configure stages with both activation and completion conditions using free-form Drools rules, the same way that milestone completion conditions are configured. For example, in the IT Orders sample project, the `Milestone 2: Order shipped` completion condition (`org.kie.api.runtime.process.CaseData(data.get("shipped") == true)`) can also be used as the completion condition for the `Order delivery` stage represented here:

Activation conditions can also be configured using a free-form Drools rule to configure the `AdHocActivationCondition` property to activate a stage. 

.Prerequisite 
* You have created a case definition in the {CENTRAL} case designer.
* You have added an ad hoc subprocess to the case definition that is to be used as a stage.

.Procedure
. With the stage selected on the case design canvas, click image:3898.png[] to open the *Properties* panel on the right.
. Open the `AdHocActivationCondition` property editor to define an activation condition for the start node. For example, `autostart: true` to make the stage automatically activated when a new case instance is started. 
. The `AdHocCompletionCondition` is set to `autocomplete` by default. To change this, open the property editor to define a completion condition using a free-form Drools expression. For example, `org.kie.api.runtime.process.CaseData(data.get("ordered") == true)` to activate the second stage in the example shown above.
