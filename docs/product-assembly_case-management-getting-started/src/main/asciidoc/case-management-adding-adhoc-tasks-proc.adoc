= Adding ad hoc tasks 

Ad hoc tasks are optional user or service tasks that are configured in a case definition. Because they are ad hoc, they must be triggered in some way, usually by a signal event or Java API call.

.Prerequisite 

* A case project has been created in {CENTRAL}.
* A case definition has been created.

.Procedure 
. In the case designer, click image:3898.png[right arrows] to open the *Object Library* on the left of the design palette.
. From the list, select a user or service task that you want to add to the case design as an ad hoc task. 
+
For example, in the IT Orders sample project, the `Order rejected` user task is an ad hoc task that would only be performed if the request for new hardware is denied by the manager. 
+
You might also want to add a user task to fill out a warranty claim if goods that are received are faulty. A warranty claim may or may not need to be completed during the course of the case, however it is available to be performed in an ad hoc way if required.
. Configure the ad hoc task properties in the *Properties* panel on the right.
. Trigger the task during runtime using a Java API call. For example, the  `Order rejected` ad hoc task is triggered by the following Java API call: `return  KieFunctions.isFalse(approved);`
