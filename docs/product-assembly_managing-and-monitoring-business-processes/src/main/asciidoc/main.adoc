3. Migrating a process (Note from Cristiano: Just to clarify, 3. Migrating a process, is relevant to this area, but it is something that is done at the technical level, not something a user would be able to achieve purely from a UI set of actions. Which makes me think that should be removed from the context of getting a process admin up to speed. Sounds that is something that a citizen developer would do.)
